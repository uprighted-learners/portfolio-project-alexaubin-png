    <div class='content2'>These picutres are very uniqe to me, because they have my name and my passion on them, I generated these images/logos through an AI App, I feel its important to share my intrests to really understand why these picctures ended being the way they are. Alex Aubin is myself and Ive been intensivley pursing my certificate in software engineering. This hense explains why these picutres are detailed with my name and code in the background, well because I love to code. Very similar to the saying "the cherry on top" is how I feel about adding logos to my porjects, with that certain logos are more enjoyable, and people can interact with them.</div>
